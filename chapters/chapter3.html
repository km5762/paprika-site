  <h2>Networked Communications</h2>
  <p>
    &emsp;The theme of internet addiction is prevalent throughout Paprika.
    Paprika, in one of the first dream sequences with the detective (Toshimi
    Konakawa), asks him "Don't you think dreams and the internet are similar,
    they are both areas where the repressed conscious mind vents" (Paprika,
    25:41). The whole reason why the detective is seeking out the dream
    sequences to begin with is due to issues with his mental health. The
    textbook describes variants of internet addiction as sharing common
    characteristics: "engaging in excessively long sessions online; becoming
    angry, tense, or depressed when forced to be away from a device; feeling a
    need to enhance online experiences by obtaining better equipment or spending
    more time online; and suffering negative social consequences." (Ethics for
    the Information Age). The detective clearly meets several of these criteria.
    For one, the entire concept of the DC mini is to spend hours at night locked
    in its dreamworld. Additionally, the detective suffers mentally without the
    mini, troubled by his incomplete nightmares, even seeking out the dreamworld
    from his workplace computer (Paprika, 25:00). The dreamworld is a place for
    the detective to vent, and live out his fantasies in a universe even more
    vivid than reality: He swings through the jungle adventurously (Paprika,
    1:06:30), he battles off an attacker like the lead in a James Bond movie
    (1:06:45). Another example of an addict is Dr. Tokita, who quite literally
    gets stuck in the dreamworld, and has to be pulled back to reality (Paprika,
    1:18:00). Similar to an internet addict, Tokita had built an unhealthy
    dependance upon the DC Mini.
    <br />
    <br />&emsp;Even more extreme examples are the characters who become "lost"
    to the simulation, like Dr. Osanai and Dr. Himuro, who are never seen again
    after the apparent destruction of the dreamworld. All this calls into
    question the idea of virtual reality, which is becoming increasingly similar
    to the DC Mini's dreamworld. If simulation is better than reality, why would
    anyone leave the simulation? <br />
    <br />&emsp;Additionally, similarly to networked communications, the DC
    Mini's dreamworld presents humanity with a new set of ethical challenges.
    What constitutes harassment vs. assault in the dreamworld? What should Dr.
    Osanai's sexual advances towards Paprika be classified as (Paprika,
    1:03:00)? Is it cyberbullying, because he did it in the dreamworld, or is
    the haptic experience and distress of the dreamworld vivid enough to be
    classified as reality? If one commits a crime in the dreamworld, ought they
    be held responsible in the real one? We will eventually have to answer these
    same questions as VR technology advances in development, and becomes
    increasingly realistic.
