  <h2>Privacy and Government</h2>
  <p>
    There is no noted government in the movieâ€™s universe. Due to this, there are
    little implications of government oversight. This is noted when Chairman Dr.
    Seijiro Inui remarked that the DCMini was not suitable for release with its
    compromised network security. Whether this was due to personal ethics, or
    fear of government retaliation, the DCMini was not released. Since this is
    the only reference to some outside governing force, there are no real
    conclusions to draw from the movie relating to this chapter.
