  <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    &emsp;Although Paprika doesn't reference any form of government in it's
    narrative, and thus does not directly incorporate themes of intellectual
    property, there are still many questions we can ask about how ownership of
    intellectual property would work with regards to Paprika's primary plot
    device, the DC Mini. For instance, would dreams be considered intellectual
    property? This is a very difficult question. If dreams are to be considered
    intellectual property, they would likely fall under copyright law because
    they are original works of authorship and, by using the DC Mini, they become
    a tangible form of expression that others can experience. However the term
    'authorship' is used very loosely here, as it is unclear who or what
    controls the events of a dream. If dreams using the DC Mini are lucid
    dreams, then the dreamer must be the author and their dream is considered a
    copyrighted work. On the other hand, if a dream is not dictated by the
    dreamer, then are they the author?; the dream may have come from their mind
    but they had no control over it's direction.
    <br />
    <br />&emsp;We can further explore this question of ownership by analyzing a
    pair of contemporary cases involving the most recent disruptive technology:
    generative AI.
    <br />
    <br />&emsp;Surprisingly, the DC Mini is not purely fiction, there is
    contemporary technology that has demonstrated some of the DC Mini's
    capabilities.

      >A study published in March of 2023</a
    >
    explored a novel method for image reconstruction using diffusion models (a
    form of generative AI) and fMRI imaging of brain activity. For the study,
    the researchers used an existing dataset of fMRI data collected from test
    subjects while the subjects viewed various images. The researchers were then
    able to use an image diffusion model in combination with the fMRI data and
    textual image descriptions to recreate the images the subjects viewed with
    surprising fidelity. Many have speculated that this technology could
    eventually be used to reconstruct images from fMRI data gathered from
    subjects who are dreaming.
    <br />
    <br />&emsp;Earlier that year in August of 2023, during the
    <a
      href="https://www.authorsalliance.org/2023/08/24/copyright-protection-in-ai-generated-works-update-decision-in-thaler-v-perlmutter/"
      ><i>Thaler v. Perlmutter</i></a
    >
    case, the District Court for the District of Columbia upheld a Copyright
    Office decision to decline Dr. Stephen Thaler's application for copyright
    registration. The copyright application that Thaler issued was for a work of
    visual art that was created by a generative AI system that Thaler created.
    This decision set a president that works of art created by generative AI are
    non-copyrightable.
    <br />
    <br />&emsp;With these two examples in mind, we must ask the question: how
    much work does the DC Mini do to 'read' the person's dream? The film does
    not explain how the DC Mini works in much detail. However, if we presume the
    device uses some form of advanced algorithm, or generative AI–similar to the
    study mentioned above–then, based on the <i>Thaler v. Perlmutter</i> case,
    the dreamer's ownership of any record of their dream is not guarantied.
    <br />
    <br />&emsp;How complex and generative does a tool have to be before an
    artist can no longer claim ownership of its output? How much of an active
    role does an artist have to play in the creation of a work for it to be
    considered theirs? Are you the author of your own dreams?
