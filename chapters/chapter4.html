  <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    Although Paprika doesn't reference any form of government in it's narrative,
    and thus does not directly incorporate themes of intellectual property,
    there are still many questions we can ask about how ownership of
    intellectual property would work with regards to Paprika's primary plot
    device, the DC Mini. For instance, would dreams be considered intellectual
    property? This is a very difficult question. If dreams are to be considered
    intellectual property, they would likely fall under copyright law because
    they are original works of authorship and, by using the DC Mini, they become
    a tangible form of expression that others can experience. However the term
    'authorship' is used very loosely here, as it is unclear who or what
    controls the events of a dream. If dreams using the DC Mini are lucid
    dreams, then the dreamer must be the author and their dream is considered a
    copyrighted work. On the other hand, if a dream is not dictated by the
    dreamer, then are they the author?; the dream may have come from their mind
    but they had no control over it's direction.
