  <h2>Information privacy</h2>
  <p>
    &emsp;In Paprika privacy and privacy of information is a rapidly explored
    topic due to one of the dreams having a lot of invasion of privacy with
    regards to someone’s dreams. Utilizing the technology of the DC Mini in its
    proper application a therapeutic specialist should be able to enter the
    dreams of an individual with their consent and record their dream in some
    sort of storage system like a file. This file can then be played back to
    review the dream. This brings up a variety of both questions and concerns.

  <p>
    &emsp;Assuming the DC Mini is only applied willingly, through its intended
    use, how does information privacy relate to dreams or alternate realities
    that don’t really exist? This dream data information and recordings are
    susceptible to theft and could reveal a lot about a person if exposed. Is
    viewing someone's dream an invasion of privacy, with or without them
    knowing? Is there a natural right that is expected that we can keep our
    thoughts to ourselves.

    &emsp;As the story progresses the DC Mini is stolen and used for more
    malicious crimes such as the DC Mini being applied to people’s dreams
    against their will. With this idea being placed into the ring it starts to
    bring up the question of the DC Mini no longer needing consent to gather
    information which is a breach of a natural right to privacy. It is shown
    that when someone becomes attacked through a DC Mini without the attachment
    they are in a dream-like state so they are not even aware of their own body
    or mind being taken over.

    &emsp;It is important to note that this is a technology that is during
    development and is being built by a private company and the information of
    the DC Mini's existence is not released to the public. Is it fair to keep
    potentially dangerous and/or potentially beneficial technology a secret from
    the public?

  <p>
    &emsp;A main privacy concern of the device is its first model not including
    access controls such as a login or parameters to make sure someone wasn’t
    using it who wasn’t authorized. This lack of a control mechanism leads to a
    very dangerous device that can be used by anyone without proper
    applications.

  <p>
    &emsp;As explored throughout the movie there are a variety of moments that
    do not pertain to technology but still reflect ethical issues related to
    privacy such as a lock-picking scene. Dr. Tokita picks a lock into Himuro’s
    apartment because he is a suspected criminal. Is it alright to break privacy
    boundaries if the defendant is a suspected criminal?
