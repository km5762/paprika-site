  <h2>Information privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Privacy in Paprika is explored in a variety of contexts, in dreams, using
    technology, and in the real world, In dreams the DC Mini invades one of the
    user's dreams and records and stores their information on a laptop. This
    process must be consensual though because it requires both users to have a
    DC Mini attached to their physical heads. As the movie progresses and the
    technology is revealed to not have access controls and is stolen, this
    consensuality is broken through use of being able to intercept people's
    minds while they are waking and without connecting a DC Mini to the
    intercepted user. As for a natural right to privacy I think it should be
    expected that technology should not allow someone to invade the thoughts of
    any person without their consent. It is important to note that this is a
    technology that is during development and is being built by a private
    company and the information of its existence is not released to the public.
    Additionally in the movie there is an ethical discussion about a lockpicking
    scene which could be juxtaposed to the internet. Dr. Tokita lock picks his
    way into Himuros apartment and claims its open and its okay because what
    himuro did was much worse. Some possible questions associated with this
    chapter are:Is viewing someone else's dreams an invasion of privacy? With or
    without them knowing? Or does it matter? Do we have a right to keep our
    thoughts secret? What if breaking in could help the person? Keeping secret
    the ideas of the new tech?
