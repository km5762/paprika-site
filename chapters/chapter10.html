  <h2>Work and Wealth</h2>
  <p>
    &emsp;The DC Mini does not allow for automation within the movie and there
    are minimal implications of the device replacing occupations in
    psychotherapy related fields as it requires an operator. The product is
    unreleased and is not contributing to Globalization. In a way the Chairman’s
    abuse in the dream world creates a “winner takes all” society by idealizing
    himself as a perfect being and gaining power through trapping others in the
    dream world. It brings about the question of whether or not a “winner takes
    all” society can be brought without the relation to money in a virtual
    world. Due to this situation with the Chairman being the only notable
    example there is little to reference about Work and Wealth in Paprika.
