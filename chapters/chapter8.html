  <h2>Computer Reliability</h2>
  <p>
    Paprika covers technology reliability in a fairly effective way, often
    showing the side effects of system or machinery failure in a catastrophic
    manner.
  </p>

  <p>
    A topic that is noted multiple times is the overuse of technology that deals
    with connecting to your brain. The science behind the technology is cryptic
    much like most movie-based tech that doesn't exist, but the claim is that
    overexposure leaves you more susceptible to breaches of DC Mini targeting
    those who have had prolonged exposure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The DC Mini overuse by Himuro led to the device practically fusing to his
    skull, which led to a situation where he later had to be operated on in
    order to attempt to save his life. Additionally, many who become attached to
    the DC Miniâ€™s dream web while they are waking turn into dream-like zombies,
    although this is somewhat unclear if it is due to a bug when targeting an
    awake person with the DC Mini or if it is controlled by the user, which
    would be more of a crime-related issue.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many issues with this technology stem from how uncharted the fusion of the
    fields between technology and dream-related reality are. How can legal
    precedent be set on practices of new technologies that are advancing faster
    than can be accounted for? Is it safe to advance technology that is not
    properly implemented?
  </p>

  <p>
    This technology was created to be used as a psychotherapy device to aid
    troubled dreamers in understanding their dreams more through therapy. Due to
    the lack of inclusion of access controls, the reliability of not only the
    product but the company was almost instantly in jeopardy and why the
    Chairman chose to cancel the program.
  </p>

  <p>
    Towards the end of the movie, the device's many bugs and issues revolve in
    the collective dreams fusing into one massive disaster that effectively
    spills into the minds of everyone and causes dreams to sort of enter
    reality. Applying this situation to the real world is immensely hard to
    grapple with, although in terms of computer reliability it should be noted
    any technology capable of malfunctioning to the point of causing a potential
    end of world scenario should be mandated.
