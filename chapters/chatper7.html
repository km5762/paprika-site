  <h2>Computer and Network Security</h2>
  <p>
    When it comes to crime and the relevant computer and network security that
    goes into preventing cyber crime, Paprika has many moments that tackle
    themes and issues related to this section in our book. One interesting idea
    is to look at the dreamscape like a completely other cyber world. People are
    able to mask their identity using guisess like pseudonyms and other
    anonymity measures to completely separate their real lives from the actions
    they do in the virtual world. The same can be applied for the dreamscape.
    Dr. Chiba Atsuko has an alter ego (Paprika) that she can act through in that
    world and have the actions completely separated from her real self. This
    raises the question whether one should be responsible or could be held
    responsible for the actions we have in our dreams. Not only that but can we
    control the events we create in our dreams? Suppose for example that one
    leaks classified data through an image in their dreams and someone who
    entered the dream (whether legally or illegally) gains access to their
    information, is the information holder accountable? Or another example: what
    if someone, or the environment in someone's dream committed violent or
    illegal act on a spectator in the dream. Is this tolerable, due to the
    inherent lack of control of the subconscious nature of dreams, or is a
    person responsible for keeping in control their inner thoughts and actions?
    Like should Kei Himuro the second friend developer be to blame for the dream
    parade that he had that ran rampant throughout his dream and not only caused
    people to go crazy when they connected to the dream, but also ended up
    merging with the real world and causing real world damage. Or when the
    dreams were merging with reality, Dr. Chiba Atsuko almost fell off a balcony
    while walking in a dream. Who would be held accountable if she fell off? Was
    Himuro a victim of the DC mini and the company is to blame, or is he to
    blame for the damage he causes. Or in another realm, what if someone was
    able to hack into the technology and by extent into someone's dream. They
    have the potential to intentionally cause some of these effects, like
    causing mental insanity to the users, or leaking personal or classified
    info. All in all the creation of this technology creates many new questions
    and ventures when it comes to crime and its related security that are very
    similar to the arms race between securities and vulnerabilities between any
    technology Going forward, do technologies like this need to be released in a
    controllable manner first so that regulations and securities can get a head
    start before the general public gets access to the technology? What's also
    interesting is the potential profit available from malefactors using this
    technology. It could be used for profit like information gathering, as
    dreams are a place where lots of the subconscious information lies more
    unprotected. Or like Paprika did, it could be used for good like psychiatric
    help, all of which could garner a profit.
