            The theme of internet addiction is prevelant throughout Paprika.
            Paprika, in one of the first dream sequences with the detective
            (Toshimi Konakawa), asks him "Don't you think dreams and the
            internet are similar, they are both areas where the repressed
            conscious mind vents" (Paprika, 25:41). The whole reason why the
            detective is seeking out the dream sequences to begin with is due to
            issues with his mental health. The textbook describes variants of
            internet addiction as sharing common characteristics: "engaging in
            excessively long sessions online; becoming angry, tense, or
            depressed when forced to be away from a device; feeling a need to
            enhance online experiences by obtaining better equipment or spending
            more time online; and suffering negative social consequences."
            (Ethics for the Information Age). The detective clearly meets
            several of these criteria. For one, the entire concept of the DC
            mini is to literally spend hours at night locked in its dreamworld.
            Additionally, the detective suffers mentally without the mini,
            troubled by his incomplete nightmares, even seeking out the
            dreamworld from his workplace computer (Paprika, 25:00). The
            dreamworld is a place for the detective to vent, and live out his
            fantasies in a universe even more vivid than reality: He swings
            through the jungle adventerously (Paprika, 1:06:30), he battles off
            an attacker like the lead in a James Bond movie (1:06:45). Another
            example of an addict is Dr. Tokita, who quite literally gets stuck
            in the dreamworld, and has to be pulled back to reality (Paprika,
            1:18:00). Similar to an internet addict, Tokita had built an
            unhealthy dependance upon the DC Mini. All this calls into question
            the idea of virtual reality, which is becoming increasingly similar
            to the DC Mini's dreamworld. If simulation is better than reality,
            why would anyone leave the simulation?

            Privacy in Paprika is explored in a variety of contexts, in dreams,
            using technology, and in the real world, In dreams the DC Mini
            invades one of the user's dreams and records and stores their
            information on a laptop. This process must be consensual though
            because it requires both users to have a DC Mini attached to their
            physical heads. As the movie progresses and the technology is
            revealed to not have access controls and is stolen, this
            consensuality is broken through use of being able to intercept
            people's minds while they are waking and without connecting a DC
            Mini to the intercepted user. As for a natural right to privacy I
            think it should be expected that technology should not allow someone
            to invade the thoughts of any person without their consent. It is
            important to note that this is a technology that is during
            development and is being built by a private company and the
            information of its existence is not released to the public.
            Additionally in the movie there is an ethical discussion about a
            lockpicking scene which could be juxtaposed to the internet. Dr.
            Tokita lock picks his way into Himuros apartment and claims its open
            and its okay because what himuro did was much worse. Some possible
            questions associated with this chapter are:Is viewing someone else's
            dreams an invasion of privacy? With or without them knowing? Or does
            it matter? Do we have a right to keep our thoughts secret? What if
            breaking in could help the person? Keeping secret the ideas of the
            new tech?

            When it comes to crime and the relevant computer and network
            security that goes into preventing cyber crime, Paprika has many
            moments that tackle themes and issues related to this section in our
            book. One interesting idea is to look at the dreamscape like a
            completely other cyber world. People are able to mask their identity
            using guisess like pseudonyms and other anonymity measures to
            completely separate their real lives from the actions they do in the
            virtual world. The same can be applied for the dreamscape. Dr. Chiba
            Atsuko has an alter ego (Paprika) that she can act through in that
            world and have the actions completely separated from her real self.
            This raises the question whether one should be responsible or could
            be held responsible for the actions we have in our dreams. Not only
            that but can we control the events we create in our dreams? Suppose
            for example that one leaks classified data through an image in their
            dreams and someone who entered the dream (whether legally or
            illegally) gains access to their information, is the information
            holder accountable? Or another example: what if someone, or the
            environment in someone's dream committed violent or illegal act on a
            spectator in the dream. Is this tolerable, due to the inherent lack
            of control of the subconscious nature of dreams, or is a person
            responsible for keeping in control their inner thoughts and actions?
            Like should Kei Himuro the second friend developer be to blame for
            the dream parade that he had that ran rampant throughout his dream
            and not only caused people to go crazy when they connected to the
            dream, but also ended up merging with the real world and causing
            real world damage. Or when the dreams were merging with reality, Dr.
            Chiba Atsuko almost fell off a balcony while walking in a dream. Who
            would be held accountable if she fell off? Was Himuro a victim of
            the DC mini and the company is to blame, or is he to blame for the
            damage he causes. Or in another realm, what if someone was able to
            hack into the technology and by extent into someone's dream. They
            have the potential to intentionally cause some of these effects,
            like causing mental insanity to the users, or leaking personal or
            classified info. All in all the creation of this technology creates
            many new questions and ventures when it comes to crime and its
            related security that are very similar to the arms race between
            securities and vulnerabilities between any technology Going forward,
            do technologies like this need to be released in a controllable
            manner first so that regulations and securities can get a head start
            before the general public gets access to the technology? What's also
            interesting is the potential profit available from malefactors using
            this technology. It could be used for profit like information
            gathering, as dreams are a place where lots of the subconscious
            information lies more unprotected. Or like Paprika did, it could be
            used for good like psychiatric help, all of which could garner a
            profit.
