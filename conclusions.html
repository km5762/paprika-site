  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>
    There are a few different conclusions that we are able to draw in relation
    to computing and society through the lens of the Paprika movie. The first
    has to do with the regulation of technology. Lots of new and innovative
    technology such as AI in the real world and the DCMini in Paprika have the
    potential to do great things for society but also cause great harm for
    society. 37% of people said they are more concerned about the changes that
    come with AI than the potential benefits [1], and in the movie, many of the
    harms of the DCMini (lack of authentication, making people go mentally
    crazy) were highlighted more than its potential upsides (psychotherapy).
    Over 100x the people are working in AI in comparison to working on its
    regulations to keep it safe [2]. Because of this we have come to the
    conclusion that more steps need to be taken to regulate new and upcoming
    technologies like these. One way this can be done is expanding general
    knowledge about the technology and its capabilities. In the movie. Only a
    select few individuals knew how to use the DCMini and all its capabilities.
    If that information was spread out more, it could have prevented some of the
    tragedies that happened to people like Doctor Torataro Shima when he jumped
    out the window in his crazed mental state.

    Another conclusion that we drew had to deal with the accountability for
    misuse of technology in a virtual world. Throughout the movie many malicious
    things were done inside of the dreamscape that didn&rsquo;t and did end up
    having effects on the real world around it. To what level should these
    people be accountable for what they do in the DCMini&rsquo;s virtual space,
    and to another extent, our online space? The internet allows for an
    unparalleled amount of anonymity as seen by Dr. Chiba Atsuko took on a whole
    other persona (Paprika) when she entered the DCMini&rsquo;s dreamscape.
