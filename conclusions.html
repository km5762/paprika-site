  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>
    &emsp;There are a few different conclusions that we can draw in relation to
    computing and society through the lens of the Paprika movie. The first has
    to do with the regulation of technology. Lots of new and innovative
    technologies such as AI in the real world and the DCMini in Paprika have the
    potential to do great things for society but also can cause great harm. AI
    has the potential to greatly help in places of automation, information
    processing, manufacturing, and much more for the future, but 37% of people
    said they are more concerned about the changes that come with AI than the
    potential benefits [1]. In the movie, a similar technological innovation is
    the DC Mini. This technology has the potential to be very helpful as seen
    through Detective Konakawa. By using the DC mini to process and grapple with
    his dreams, he gets led through psychotherapy and calls it a blessing that
    he wishes he knew about earlier([0] 24:00). But this tech isn&rsquo;t
    without its harms. As seen in the movie at many points people were driven
    mentally insane through their use of the technology. Especially when
    connected with the almost virus-like dream parade. This caused people to
    lose hold of themselves and make rash decisions such as Dr Shima who in a
    crazed state, jumped out of a high building window. These potential
    downsides are things that need to be considered when creating and innovating
    new technology, and currently, there aren't enough people working on these
    issues. Over 100x the people are working in AI in comparison to working on
    its regulations to keep it safe [2]. Because of this, we have come to the
    conclusion that the government should regulate these private technology
    innovations more for the good of society. As an example, there are
    real-world instances where the government took a greater regulatory role and
    it led to positive regulation and increased security. When doing clinical
    studies the government has strict entrance requirements for safety and
    reliability [3] Another example is the technology Neuralink. Its brain
    implant technology is potentially very innovative but has been denied human
    trials due to its failure to meet FDA safety standards [4].

    &emsp;Another conclusion that we drew had to deal with the accountability
    for the misuse of technology in a virtual world. We concluded that there
    should be increased accountability for our actions in digital space and
    online. The internet is a world completely separated from the real world and
    with it comes a way to hide our true selves. It is easier than ever to
    remain almost completely anonymous to the people we interact with online.
    This is also true for the virtual &ldquo;dreamscape&rdquo; that is created
    by the DC Mini. People are able to enter dreams almost like virtual reality,
    and people like Dr. Chiba can use this platform to hide behind a digital
    identity. Many of the main characters didn&rsquo;t even know Paprika's true
    identity till the end of the movie. With this anonymity comes a great ease
    of misuse of tech and the corresponding digital spaces. This lack of
    connection to a physical person makes &ldquo;crypto crimes&rdquo; paying for
    crime via cryptocurrency, much easier to commit [5]. Alongside that, online
    harassment and cyberbullying are big problems because of their negative
    effects on people's well-being outside of these virtual spaces.
    Cyberbullying/Stalking or other tech misuse leads to lasting levels of high
    distress in over 30% of victims, and over 25% report having trouble sleeping
    after online abuse[6]. What makes it worse is that anonymity provides little
    to no consequences for these actions. This is why people want some sort of
    accountability for actions people take in the digital world. 81% of
    Americans say that laws need to be strengthened to hold cyberbullies
    accountable for their actions [6]. Other groups are clamoring for increased
    identification online in order to protect youth and other groups at risk of
    exploitation, antisocial, and fraudulent behavior. This is because, as we
    have seen in the movie as well, people's actions in these online spaces can
    have effects significantly outside their virtual homes. Whether that be the
    mental instability of the DC mini users, or the dream world literally
    merging with the real world and causing havoc and destruction along the
    streets, what we do online matters, and responsibility is needed to prevent
    these malicious outcomes.

    &emsp;A third conclusion that we drew was that the use of technological
    devices provides deep insights into the user&rsquo;s subconscious. In the
    movie, this connection is obvious: The DC mini quite literally allows the
    user to view their dreams, as well as the dreams of others. For many of the
    characters, this allows them a newfound form of expression that the real
    world lacks. Paprika, for example, navigates the vibrantly colored
    dreamworld as a whimsical fairy, whereas the real world is presented in drab
    grayscale ([0] 46:50). Even the way sequences are shot is different between
    the real world and the dreamworld: Notice that, before she enters the
    dreamworld, the cinematography is relatively static ([0] 46:34), whereas the
    dreamworld employs faster action cuts ([0] 50:50). Detective Konokawa gains
    insight into his repressed dreams of becoming a movie maker, and the trauma
    of his childhood friend dying. At the end of the movie we see this come full
    circle, as Konokawa speaks to his friend through a vision where he is told
    that &ldquo;You just lived out our movie in real life&rdquo; ([0] 1:24:20).
    For other characters, like Dr. Tokita, the DC mini brings to light
    underlying addictive tendencies. Throughout the film, Tokita is portrayed as
    someone addicted to their work ([0] 36:20) and food ([0] 19:48). The DC mini
    becomes the next object of his addiction, literally trapping him inside its
    dreamworld ([0] 45:30) Additionally, these same phenomena are present in
    real life. The smartphone is an example of a technology that exacerbated
    device addiction. Considering its ease of use and accessibility, more people
    than ever have one and are spending an hour more on average than on a
    computer [7]. Additionally, MySpace surveys have found that user&rsquo;s
    tend to present idealized online personas, in a similar way that the
    characters in Paprika do [8]. Further studies also suggest that we model our
    behavior in real life after the traits our digital avatars exhibit. One such
    study, for instance, found that users with taller avatars are more likely to
    be more aggressive negotiators [9], further suggesting that our mental state
    is closely linked to our technological representations.
