  <h2>Author's Intent</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Paprika</em> was released in 2006 with a major theme focused on the
    synergy between dreams and reality. The intent of the movie maker for the
    film <em>Paprika</em> is somewhat difficult to gather because the director,
    Satoshi Kon, intended on creating the movie as an adaptation to Yasutaka
    Tsutsui’s book of the same name. It is important to take into account both
    the intentions of both Kon and Tsutsui.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tsutsui when creating the book was literally writing from his own dreams. He
    came up with the story of <em>Paprika</em> and many of the scenes from his
    own subconscious mind while he was asleep dreaming. His intent was simply to
    share his dreams with the world and considers <em>Paprika</em> to be “The
    culmination of what I consider to be entertainment”<sup>[1]</sup>.

  <p>
    Kon took on the project from the personal request from Tsutsui almost a full
    decade after he was originally looking to make his book into a visual
    experience. Thus a lot of Kon’s intent when making the movie was simply
    believing there was a purpose in leading such a visual piece of literature
    such as Tsutsui’s Novel into a film. Kon additionally took inspiration from
    Tsutsui’s technique and allowed his subconscious minds of dreams and
    creativity to take the wheel for development of the movie.

    In order to interpret Kon’s intention with creating the movie we can take a
    look at statements from Kon to interpret his message. Kon in a statement
    about the movie summed up how he “Changed everything but the basic
    story”<sup>[2]</sup>. Kon noted in an interview about the connection between
    dreams and the internet saying “they are two universes which remove us from
    reality”<sup>[2]</sup>. Additionally, Kon when asked about a line from the
    movie “The Internet and dreams are the means of expressing the inhibitions
    of mankind,”<sup>[3]</sup> He responded how “by participating in chat rooms
    and Internet forums, people free themselves from their daily oppression.” An
    important scene in the movie that actually contains the butlers, two
    characters voice acted by Satoshi Kon and Yasutaka Tsutsui takes place in a
    realm somewhere between dreams and the internet. It could be inferred
    through these statements and the inclusion of the relation between dreams
    and the internet that Kon’s intent of producing this movie could be a
    commentary on the similarities between living through alternate realities
    whether it be dreaming or through the internet, although this is just
    speculation.
